<!-- Favicon
A favicon is a small image that sits on the chrome tab.
Back in the head tag we need to add a special tag called link
Link takes three attributes
rel="icon" 
type="image/x-icon"
href=""
The href will link to an image address of something like an apple -->
    <link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="https://pixahive.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Apple-illustration-413444-pixahive.jpg">

<!-- ----Go to the button that leads to the recipe. Under the body. Will be below the h1 tag.     -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
    <link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Baloo+Tamma+2&family=Lemonada:wght@300&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 id="top">LEARN's Apple Pie</h1>
    <h2> A spoonful or forkful will make your worries go bye!</h2>

<!-- Button
Lastly Let’s make a button on the top of the page to take our user to the recipe if they just want the information.
First we’ll set up a div around the recipe and give it the id of recipe
<div id=’recipe’></div> or assign id='recipe' to h3 tag on recipe near ingredient list
Next we’ll create an anchor tag at the top of the page the will send us to the recipe
And then inside that a tag we’ll create a button tag that will show the words take me to the recipe -->
    <a href="#recipe">
      <button>Take me to the recipe</button>
    </a> 

<!-- **no share screen**
Okay let's break into our pairs again and finish up the section on HTML in the ‘Jumpstart Weekend Student Notes’ 
We’ll come back together for checkout at 8:40pm -->

<!-- Table
Explore nesting HTML elements by creating a basic table.
Table
(say this after creating tables) And if we want to add some temporary style to our table we can use an attribute (inline styling) -->
    <p>There are so many apple varieties to choose from when making apple pie. Here a few common varieties</p>
      <table border=1>

<!-- Table Row -->
        <tr>

<!-- Table Data <td>
(2 rows of 2 table data, refresh browser and show 1X1, 2X2, 3X3, show one large block with other rows) -->
          <td>Granny Smith</td>
          <td>Honeycrisp</td>
          <td>Jazz</td>

<!-- HTML - Part two
**yes screen share**
Footer
A footer is a standard section of any web page and generally hold some information regarding 
the authors of the site
where more information can be found
possibly a link to some external resource
To create a footer we simply make a tag with the word footer -->
    <footer>

<!-- In this tag I can put a copyright logo © with the names of my team -->
      &copy LEARN Instructors and TAs | Jumpstart |

<!-- What would make this footer even better would be a link to take me back to the top of the page
Anchor Tags and Navigation
So let's make a navigation link in footer to the top of the page so people don’t have to scroll all the way up. 
The anchor tag is how we create those famous blue links in HTML
The Anchor tag is simply an HTML tag made with the letter “a”
The Anchor tag takes an attribute of href and then the place we want the link to go       -->
      <a href="#top">Top of page</a>
<!-- And we also need to add an id=’top’ to the first element in our <body> tag -->

<!-- Link to external website
An <a> tag with link to where I got the recipe from https://littlespoonfarm.com/apple-pie-recipe/ -->
      <a href="https://littlespoonfarm.com/apple-pie-recipe/" target="_blank">Apple Pie Recipe</a>
    </footer>

<!-- --Go to the area where a table resides after the list of ingredients -->
